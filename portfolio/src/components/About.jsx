        Hey! my name is Ethan Babaev, and I am a 27-year-old software
        engineering graduate from Sami Shamoon College of Engineering. As a
        recent graduate, I am excited to start my career in the field of
        frontend development. Though I don't have any professional experience
        yet, I have been honing my skills in coding and design through various
        personal projects and coursework. I am proficient in HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and React and have a keen eye for detail and aesthetics. I
        am also a quick learner and thrive in collaborative environments. I am
        currently seeking opportunities to work as a frontend developer and
        contribute to innovative projects. I am confident that my skills and
        passion for coding make me a valuable addition to any team. Thank you
        for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you.
